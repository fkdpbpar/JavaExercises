Please try all the exercises in the terminal. It will help you a lot. You can get help from Netbeans if you are stuck. Take care of imports if you use Scanner class.

 

1. What class in school are you going according to age;
   Use an if-else-if.
   For example: 5-12 dimotiko, ...
   Can you use a switch statement?

 

2. What to do every day (switch). Monday-Friday: go to work. Sat-Sun: relaxing

 

3. What season is according to month. Enter month from terminal.

 

4. Print the number of days each month has. Use switch.

 

5. Get message ("Perfect, Good, Pass, Fail") based on grade (A, B, C-D, the rest). 

 

6. Based on age what can you do?
lt 16>>You cannot drive
16-17>>You can drive but not vote
18-21>>You can vote but not drink
gt 22>>You can do anything 

 

7. Program should ask your weight and planet. Compute your weight on the planet based on the table below:
#    Planet    Relative gravity
1    Venus        0.78
2    Mars        0.39
3    Jupiter    2.65
4    Saturn    1.17
5    Uranus    1.05
6    Neptune    1.23
So, for example, if your weight is 80 kg on earth, then you would weigh just over 31 kg on Mars, since Mars' gravity is 0.39 times earth's gravity. (80 * 0.39 is 31.20)

 

8. Use ternary to return a message child or adult. Older than 18 is adult.

 

9. Create a program that stores the names of your 4 best friends in an array. Then print these names from the array. Use for-traditional, for enhanced, while, do-while.

 

10. Let's create a program that creates a class with students and shows where each student is seating. The program should first ask you 2 questions:


	
How many rows does the class have?
	How many students does the class have?

Then calculate how many seats each row has. If you calculate that one row must have more seats than the others, then put the extra seats on the last row.
Next, you have to place student names in each seat. The program will choose a random seat that is empty and ask you to enter the student's name (Use class Random). If a seat is not empty, the program should not ask you to enter a name for that seat. This should continue until all the seats are filled. Each time that you are asked to enter a name for a seat, you should be informed about the empty seats remaining. For example:
X seats are empty!
Please enter student's name for seat [0][2]:
When all seats are filled, the program should thank you and print the structure of the class. Each student in the same row should be separated by tab space. Use \t for tab space like we use \n for new line.
